# Folder scan script

Utility for getting a list of PDFs in the folders and sub-folders.
All the files are usually located in the folder called DVF.
Final target would be copy those PDFs in a new folder.
We're talking about roughly 1.200 folders, so going one by one would be a huge waste of time.
Thank God python exists :)
